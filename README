Auth Username Module
====================
Version: 0.3 beta
Created by: Jeremy Shipman <jeremy@burnbright.co.nz> www.burnbright.co.nz

This module introduces username authentication.
It also provides additional functionality for retrieving usernames and password.

Please note that SilverStripe has been originally built with Email being the primary form of authentication, so some
core/module features may not work so well. I have included a patch for giving MemberTableField support for usernames.

Setup:
======
Copy the module folder to your SilverStripe site's root directory.

The module's _config.php file automatically:
 * adds the UsernameAuthenticator to the set of registered authenticators
 * decorates Member with a 'Username' DB field, and functions for generating a username, and for generating a 

password

In your site _config.php optionally add either of the following:

Authenticator::set_default_authenticator("UsernameAuthenticator"); // makes username authentication default
Authenticator::unregister("MemberAuthenticator"); // removes default email + password authentication
